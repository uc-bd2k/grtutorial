<p>
  Commonly, relative cell count at the end of treatment is used to assess drug
  response. Across a range of concentrations, the measured cell count or a
  surrogate of it (e.g. measurement of ATP using CellTiter-GloÂ®) is normalized
  to the cell count of DMSO-treated controls grown on the same plate under the
  same conditions. For each condition (combination of cell line, drug, and drug
  concentration), we define the relative cell count as
  <span class="math">x(c)/x<sub>ctrl</sub></span>, where <span class="math">x(c)</span> is
  the count in the presence of drug and
  <span class="math">x<sub>ctrl</sub></span> is the 50%-trimmed mean of the
  count for control cells. Based on a sigmoidal curve fitted to the relative
  cell count across different concentrations, one can define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>IC<sub>50</sub></em> (50% relative cell count), which is the most
    commonly used metric but one that can only be defined if the relative cell
    count decreases during the assay to below 50% of the starting value;
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>EC<sub>50</sub></em> (half-point of the sigmoidal curve);
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>E<sub>inf</sub></em> (the asymptotic efficacy), which differs from
    <em>E<sub>max</sub></em> (the maximal measured efficacy); and
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>AUC</em> (area under, or over, the curve), which captures both
    <em>IC<sub>50</sub></em> and <em>E<sub>max</sub></em> to some extent and
    is more robust to experimental noise than other metrics.
  </li>
</ul>

    <h1>Examples of dose-response curves based on relative cell count.</h1>
    In the first example (left), a strong drug response results in an E<sub>inf</sub>
    close to 0 and a well-defined IC<sub>50</sub>. In the second (right), a
    partial response results in an E<sub>inf</sub> above 0.5 and an undefined
    IC<sub>50</sub>.
