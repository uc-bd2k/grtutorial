To simulate the effect of division time on GR and conventional drug-response
metrics under different assumptions about the degree of cytostasis or cell
killing, we developed a theoretical model of drug response. To the first
approximation, cell growth can be considered exponential, with drugs either
decreasing the division rate or killing cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner:

where *x* is the cell count, *k* is the untreated growth rate (per day), *c* is
the drug concentration, *S<sub>M</sub>* is the maximal inhibitory effect,
*SC<sub>50</sub>* is the concentration at half-maximal effect of drug, and *h*
is the Hill coefficient. The growth rate *k* corresponds to the division rate
*k<sub>0</sub>* as *k = ln(2)&#8901;k<sub>0</sub> = ln(2)/T<sub>d</sub>*, where
*T<sub>d</sub>* is the division time. *S<sub>M</sub>* can be larger than 1 to
account for drugs inducing cell death at a specific phase of the cell cycle.

Integrating these equations for an assay of *t* days yields the cell count at
concentration *c*:

where *x<sub>0</sub> = x(t = 0)* is the cell number at the time of treatment.
Thus, the relative cell count is:

<img src="images/image00.png" style="height: 60px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;"/>

where *x<sub>ctrl</sub> &#8801; x(0)*, and the normalized growth rate inhibition (*GR
value*) is:

<img src="images/image09.png" style="height: 60px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;"/>

This equation for *GR&#40;c\)* is independent of the length of the assay *t* and
the untreated growth rate *k*, and, thus, the metrics *GR<sub>50</sub>*,
*GR<sub>max</sub>*, *GR<sub>AOC</sub>*, and *h<sub>GR</sub>* are also
independent of *t* and *k*.
